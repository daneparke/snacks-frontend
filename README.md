# Snacks Front End
Snack rating web application that allows users to add reviews on snacks, report reviews, and edit/delete the users own reviews. As an admin on the site you have access to delete any users reviews, add reviews on snacks, edit/delete your own reviews, creating new snacks, and editing/deleting existing snacks. 
As my time at Galvanize was coming to an end we were given the task to create a full stack application using a new technology, in 10 days. I created this mobile app, using React Native and Redux for my new technologies. 

Packr Trackr is a way for backpackers in the hostel community to stay connected. A user can checkin to a hostel, have access to the hostel's message board and the ability to view people currently staying at the hostel. This allows backpackers to broadcast messages to the entire hostel about adventures/activites that they want to go on. My app also allows backpackers to track their friends trips, message friends, and be notified if they their friend ends up being in the same town they are currently in.
